## Document Processing Pipeline for Historical Documents (TEI XML Output)
This project automates the conversion of scanned historical documents into a structured and searchable TEI XML  format, facilitating analysis and archiving. It leverages the ocrd processor suite for efficient handling of document images and incorporates a flexible approach to accommodate document variations.

##### Project Goals
* Structured Output: Generate TEI XML files, an established standard for encoding historical documents.
* Document Versatility: Handle documents with varying characteristics, employing appropriate processing steps based on their specific needs.
* Metadata Extraction: Extract relevant metadata like title, author, date, and page numbers.
  
##### System Requirements
* Operating System: Ubuntu or similar Linux distribution (consider WSL for Windows users: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
* ocrd_all Package: Provides tools for document image processing and OCR (installation instructions: https://ocr-d.de/en/setup)
- Additional libraries might be required based on the specific configuration.
* Python: Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
