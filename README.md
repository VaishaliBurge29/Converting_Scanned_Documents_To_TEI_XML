#### Document Processing Pipeline for Historical Documents (TEI XML Output)
***************************
This project automates the conversion of scanned historical documents into a structured and searchable TEI XML format, facilitating analysis and archiving. It leverages the ocrd processor suite for efficient handling of document images and incorporates a flexible approach to accommodate document variations.

#### Project Goals

* Structured Output: Generate TEI XML files, an established standard for encoding historical documents.
* Document Versatility: Handle documents with varying characteristics, employing appropriate processing steps based on their specific needs.
* Metadata Extraction: Extract relevant metadata like title, author, date, and page numbers.

#### Features

* Processes scanned documents (potentially in PDF format).
* Performs pre-processing tasks (details to be added based on your implementation).
* Extracts text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
* Generates TEI XML files representing the document structure and content.

#### Technologies

* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Engine
* Python
* TEI XML Libraries
* Additional Libraries (Optional): Depending on your specific implementation, mention any additional libraries used for pre-processing tasks (e.g., image manipulation), post-processing (e.g., data normalization), or other functionalities

#### System Requirements and Setup

* Operating System: Ubuntu or similar Linux distribution (consider WSL for Windows users: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
* Python: Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* ocrd_all Package: Provides tools for document image processing and OCR (installation instructions: https://ocr-d.de/en/setup)
- Additional libraries might be required based on the specific configuration.
- For instructions tailored to your needs, you can use the documentation [here](https://github.com/VaishaliBurge29/Converting_Scanned_Documents_To_TEI_XML.git) detailing various processing steps within the OCR-D framework.

#### Running the Project

##### Installation:
1. Clone the Repository: git clone
      https://github.com/VaishaliBurge29/Converting_Scanned_Documents_To_TEI_XML.git
2. Project Structure:
     - Data folder: This folder contains all your scanned documents. You can organize these documents further using subfolders if needed.
     - Preprocessing folder (Optional): This folder can contain scripts or tools used for any pre-processing steps your pipeline requires before OCR (e.g., noise reduction, skew correction). You can include instructions on how to run these pre-processing steps if they are separate from the main script.
     - Images folder (Optional): If your pipeline involves working with intermediate image files during processing, this folder might store those temporary images.
     - Output folder: This folder stores the final TEI XML output files generated by the pipeline.
Prerequisites:
     - Operating System: The pipeline is primarily developed for Ubuntu or similar Linux distributions. Instructions for other operating systems can be added if applicable (e.g., using WSL on Windows).
Python: Ensure you have Python (Specify the required Python version if necessary) installed on your system.

#### Execution

This project doesn't require users to directly run a script. It's designed to process documents within the folders and generate TEI XML files in the output folder using the Python code provided.

#### Contents of Files


1. All 24 document folders are uploaded in `data` folder
2. Each document in the `data` folder has the processed pages after going through the processing steps by processors.
3. The output folder is located inside the `data` folder, which includes
     - Combined hOCR file 
     - TEI XML conversion python code 
     - TEI XML output file.
4. In `lib` folder you can find python code for splitting tiff documents into individual document and combining hocr code is also included in the main branch.
5. It also has our Report Document in `documentation` folder.
